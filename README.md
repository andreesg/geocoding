# Geocoding Prototype

This is a simple example application using Google Maps SDK that allows us to:

  - Do geocoding / reverse geocoding
  - Calculate routes between a set of points
  - Import coordinates from a .csv file and display them on the map

The application front-end uses jquery, jquery-ui, underscore and twitter bootstrap and it has a very simple backend for authentication.

Main.js is the file you should read.
